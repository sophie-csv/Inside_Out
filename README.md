### What was the hardest part of this project? Why did you have a harder time with this part? (Minimum 2 Sentences)

### Debugging is an important part of the iterative design process. Describe a bug you encountered and how you went about fixing it. (Minimum 4 Sentences)

 A bug I encountered was that my lever animation was not working. I first went through all the animation steps and tried to pinpoint where the error was. When I found the error, I tried changing the value of the variable to see exactly what it does. I also asked for outside help. Then I fixed the error and I could apply it to future animations!

### What is a feature of GMS2 that you learned about when doing this project? How do you plan to use this feature in future projects? (Minimum 2 Sentences)

I learned that I could add different instance layers to keep my objects organised. This helped keep my ball and character objects separate from my foreground.
